This script generates words that conform to something resembling english phonotactics
(the rules about what sounds can come in what places within a syllable).
I generated my tables of legal syllable parts from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_phonology#Phonotactics),
which admittedly cites some weird and archaic words.

The script's output is a dirty mix of International Phonetic Alphabet for some consonant sounds
and regular english for vowels (IPA vowels are complicated).

The quick and dirty guide to IPA:
ʃ = "sh"
θ = "th"
ŋ = "ng"
ʒ = "j", but the soft j that you see in french.  English j is more like "dʒ"
j = y

See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) for more accurate details.

Yes, the program named itself.
